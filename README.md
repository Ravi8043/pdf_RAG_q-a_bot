# PDF RAG Question-Answering Bot

A Python-based application that implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for question-answering on PDF documents.

## Overview

This repository contains a question-answering system that uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to provide accurate answers from PDF documents. The system combines the power of large language models with document retrieval to generate contextually relevant responses.

## Features

- PDF document processing and text extraction
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation
- Question-answering capabilities
- Document context awareness
- Python-based implementation

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages (install via `pip`):
  - langchain (for RAG implementation)
  - PyPDF2 or pdfplumber (for PDF processing)
  - transformers or similar for embeddings
  - Additional dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ravi8043/pdf_RAG_q-a_bot.git
cd pdf_RAG_q-a_bot
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

[Add specific usage instructions based on your implementation]

## How It Works

1. **PDF Processing**: The system processes PDF documents and extracts text content
2. **Document Indexing**: Extracted content is indexed and embedded for efficient retrieval
3. **Query Processing**: User questions are processed and relevant context is retrieved
4. **Answer Generation**: Combines retrieved context with LLM capabilities to generate accurate answers
